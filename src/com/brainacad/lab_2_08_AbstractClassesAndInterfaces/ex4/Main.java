 Goal
    Getting a practical experience in
        Using inheritance and interfaces.
 Task
    Add code to main() method in class Main to create array (Rectangle[] arr2) of six Rectangle objects and sort it using Arrays.sort() method.
    Add code to main() method in class Main to iterate over Rectangles array in loop (use for-each loop) and invoke draw() method.

 Execute the program, output must looks like:
        This is Rectangle, color: RED, width=10, height=10,  area is: 100
        This is Rectangle, color: RED, width=11, height=22,  area is: 242
        This is Rectangle, color: RED, width=100, height=5,  area is: 500
        â€¦

 No special preparation
 Execution\ methodology
    Remind that  student should apply his or her knowledge of:
        how to sort arrays;

 Execute following steps:
    Add code to class Main
    Student should execute program

 Evaluation	No special evaluation
 Closure	Issues discussion, on demand
 Reporting	No special reporting
