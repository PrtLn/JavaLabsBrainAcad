/**
 * Created by L.Pikalova on 9/18/2016.
 * Lab Work 2-3-2
 Goal
    Getting a practical experience in
        Design constructors without parameters.
 Task
    Add to class MyWindow constructor without parameters,
        which will initialize classâ€™s fields by some default values.
    Create instance of class MyWindow using constructor without parameters.

 Preparation	No special preparation

 Execution\ methodology
    Remind that  student should apply his or her knowledge of:
        how to create constructor
    Execute following steps:
        Student should add constructor without parameters to class MyWindow.
        Student should provide all necessary code in a constructor without parameters.

 Evaluation	the program must work correctly;
 Closure	Issues discussion, on demand
 Reporting	No special reporting
