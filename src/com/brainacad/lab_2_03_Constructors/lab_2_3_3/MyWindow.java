/**
 * Created by L.Pikalova on 9/18/2016.
 * Lab Work 2-3-3
 Goal
    Getting a practical experience in
        Design constructors that provide better user interface
        and at the same time assure the integrity of the data that the instances of the class represent
 Task
    Add to class Window overload constructors, which will initialize classâ€™ fields,
        depend from what data we will put there:
            MyWindow(width, height),
            MyWindow(width, height, numberOfGlass).
    Finally class MyWindow must have four constructors)

 Preparation	No special preparation

 Execution\ methodology
    Remind that  student should apply his or her knowledge of:
        how to create overload constructors
     Execute following steps:
        Student should create two overloaded  constructors

 Evaluation	the program must work correctly;
 Closure	Issues discussion, on demand
 Reporting	No special reporting
