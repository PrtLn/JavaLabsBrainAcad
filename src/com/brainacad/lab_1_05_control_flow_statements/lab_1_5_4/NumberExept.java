/**
 * Created by L.Pikalova on 09/04/2016.
 * Lab Work 1-5-4
 Goal:
    Getting a practical experience in
        Writing simple console application, using nested loop end if-else construction.
 Task:
    The program must print the first 10 numbers that is divisible evenly by 3 or 4 , but the for loop iterates from 1 to 300.
        (so break statement must be used after 10 printed result).
    The output shall look:
             3
             4
             â€¦
             20

 Preparation:    No special preparation

 Execution\ methodology:
    Remind that  student should apply his or her knowledge of:
        how to use if-else statement
        how to use loops and nested loops
    Execute following steps:
        - Student should create a new blank Java Project in IDE.
        - Student should create his or her own Java class and provide all necessary code in a method main()
        - Student should use if-else statment and nested loop.
    Ask student to execute the program

 Evaluation:  the program must work correctly;
 Closure:     Issues discussion, on demand
 Reporting:   No special reporting
