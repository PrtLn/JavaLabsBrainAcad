/**
 * Created by L.Pikalova on 03/09/2016.
 * Lab Work 1-5-1
 Goal:
    Getting a practical experience in
        -Writing simple console application, using standard output and nested loop.
 Task:
    Write a program to produce on console the following :
 Â 
 1
 2  1
 3 2  1
 4 3 2  1
 5 4 3 2  1
 6 5 4 3 2  1
 7 6 5 4 3 2  1
 8 7 6 5 4 3 2  1

 Preparation:   No special preparation

 Execution\ methodology:
    Remind that  student should apply his or her knowledge of:
        how to use loops and nested loops
    Execute following steps:
        - Student should create a new blank Java Project in IDE.
        - Student should create his or her own Java class and provide all necessary code in a method main()
        - Student should use System.out.println() and loops.
    Ask student to execute the program

 Evaluation:   the program must work correctly;
 Closure:      Issues discussion, on demand
 Reporting:    No special reporting
